    <h3 class="h3">Profile</h3>
    <p class="p">. I discovered my passion for software development when I was a teenager. As the passion grew stronger, I decided to improve in all the various programming languages. Considering the opportunities and hard work during these years of development, it has provided me with the skills I need today. I am most confident with <u>HTML5</u>, <u>CSS3</u>, <u>JavaScript</u>, <u>PHP</u>, <u>mySQL</u>, <u>phpMyAdmin</u>, <u>ASP.NET</u>, <u>Python</u> and <u>Java</u>. Moreover, I am currently improving my understanding for the neural network processes of a machine and its existence.  </p><br>
    <p class="p">. Recently graduated in <b>Software Engineering</b> from <b>University of Greenwich (London)</b> with a demonstrated background knowledge of both university and personal projects. </p><br />
    <p class="p">
        . As for hobbies, I enjoy practising the technical skills even if it takes hours. I love it.
        Otherwise, I prefer to exercise while not practising on my computer skills; whether its the gym or play sports. Occasionally, I squeeze in my time to play some of my favourite computer games as it is leading to my relaxation and imagination to later put into reality for my work. Characteristically, I can define myself as a performer. I like to get the job done. period. Also I can consider myself as a motivator. I prefer to motivate people/team so that the job at hand is done according to the deadline. Learning new skills is an important step to a successful life.
